**Equipdle** is a web-based guessing game centered around the items from Old School RuneScape. The primary objective for the player is to identify a secret equipable item of the day selected by the system. With each guess, the game provides comparative feedback across several of the item's attributes, guiding the player toward the correct answer.



## How to Play
